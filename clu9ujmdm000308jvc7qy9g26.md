The demand for security professionals is increasing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 5% growth in the security guard industry in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) by 2024. Across various sectors, clients rely on licensed [security guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard) to safeguard their personnel and assets.

With the rapid expansion of the security industry and the persistent demand for security guard services, numerous individuals are expressing interest in embarking on a career as a security guard. This field presents a diverse range of opportunities, with security guards being deployed in various settings, such as monitoring access to large-scale construction sites, managing unruly crowds at sporting events, and safeguarding residential communities from potential theft. The allure of security jobs lies in their ability to provide a blend of excitement and adventure, coupled with the gratification of ensuring the protection of individuals and assets from harm.

Nevertheless, it can be perplexing to comprehend the prerequisites and education necessary to become a certified security professional. Training requirements vary across states and security companies. For those seeking to enter the profession, it is crucial to possess knowledge of the fundamental requirements, training, and continuing education necessary to construct their security guard résumés and achieve successful careers.

# How to Get Your First Security Guard Position

* **Review the Basic Requirements**
    

To be eligible for a security guard license in your state, certain fundamental criteria must be met. While these requirements may vary slightly from state to state, they generally align across the country. Some key considerations for applying for a security guard license include:

* **Age Requirement:** You must be at least 18 years of age.
    
* **Background Investigation:** A thorough background investigation is mandatory.
    
* **Fingerprint Scan:** You will be required to provide a fingerprint scan.
    
* **Drug Testing:** In some cases, you may be subject to drug testing.
    
* **Educational Qualification:** A high school diploma or General Education Development (GED) certificate is necessary.
    
* **Security Guard Training:** Completion of security guard training as per your state's requirements is essential.
    

If you have any uncertainties regarding the specific requirements in your state or municipality, it is advisable to contact your state licensing board. They can provide you with detailed information on the basic requirements and training needs. Additionally, you may choose to reach out to local security guard companies to gain insights into the licensing and training regulations in your area.

**Complete an Accredited Training Program**

To become certified, candidates must complete a security guard training program. The hours required and the format of the classes may vary from state to state. However, most training programs include an initial 8-hour class that covers some foundational security skills. Following these eight hours, most training programs include some combination of security classes, physical training classes or on-the-job training that total approximately 40 hours.

Many people these days choose to complete their training online rather than attend an in-person course. While this is common, it is important to do your research to make sure that your training program is accredited in your state and provides the training you need to receive your license and obtain a job.

A typical security guard training program will cover a variety of topics that security guards working in most positions will need to be successful in their roles. Some of the topics and skills covered generally include:

* ***Power to arrest***
    
* ***De-escalation tactics***
    
* ***Identifying suspicious behavior***
    
* ***Restraining dangerous individuals***
    
* ***Understanding the laws protecting people and property***
    
* ***Terrorism prevention***
    
* ***Public relations and communication***
    
* ***Anti-discrimination training***
    

Other additional training may be required based on the unique requests of the security guard company that hires a candidate. Many prospective security guards who wish to fulfill certain specialized security roles may see the need to obtain additional certifications. For example, armed guards will need to acquire the proper certifications to carry and use firearms. Other security guards may deem it beneficial to become certified in CPR and other basic life-saving techniques.

**Apply for Security Guard Positions**

Once a candidate obtains the appropriate license for their state, they can then begin to apply for security guard positions. There are a wide variety of security jobs out there, with more and more becoming available every day. Like in any other profession, it is encouraged for new security guards to consider their ideal career path within the profession.

If there is a specific specialty that interests you, develop a plan to obtain the skills and certifications you may need for those roles. If you are considering a career in law enforcement, choose positions and educational opportunities, such as a criminal justice degree, to put yourself in the best position for success.
