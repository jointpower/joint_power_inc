Does your business or community has a comprehensive action plan in place for emergency or natural disaster security services? At [Joint Power Security](https://www.jointpowersecurity.com), we firmly believe that security for your business goes beyond just preventing violence or theft. In the unfortunate event of a major disaster, looting and disorder often occur. Having an emergency response security team ready can help ensure the safety of your business assets while you and your employees are away.

### The key reasons for being prepared with an emergency response security team include:

* Immediate and appropriate response from security personnel during emergencies or unforeseen circumstances, such as alarm malfunctions, civil unrest, and public hazards.
    
* Access control with authorized personnel access only
    
* Support from armed and/or unarmed security guards
    
* In the event of any damage, the security guard will provide a comprehensive report detailing any safety concerns or hazards, and will assess whether it is safe to schedule repairs.
    
* Continuous monitoring of situations as they develop
    
* Security personnel maintain open lines of communication with local law enforcement agencies, search and rescue teams, and emergency response units.
    
* Security personnel can assist on site as needed until business operations have returned to normal
    
* Employees will feel assured of their safety and be notified of any unsafe zones
    
* You save money
    

Sudden natural hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides, fires or floods, trigger severe disaster situations with devastating effects. Financial service providers, disaster relief facilities and retail stores are just a few examples that are at risk of crime, violence and property breaches. Individuals and communities as a whole feel the impact of a natural disaster. Several agencies including law enforcement and first responders play major roles in the immediate response of a natural disaster and can be spread thin as resources are dispersed to alleviate immediate danger and provide emergency help. Emergency Response [Security](https://www.jointpowersecurity.com) can augment local agencies, alleviating some of the pressure on them and directly help local businesses and the community.

### Recent Emergency Response Security Efforts

Several counties throughout [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California) experienced some of the most devastating fires ever faced. Most notable was the Thomas Fire that culminated in the Montecito Mudslide in 2018. The disaster’s aftermath affected numerous homes and businesses. Looters, burglars and other criminals took advantage of a vulnerable community. Law enforcement was called to address many of the home invasions, but businesses and wealthy estates needed 24-hour security personnel to secure property and assets.

This is where [Joint Power Security](https://www.jointpowersecurity.com/security-guard-in-california) can help. We have the experience to respond quickly and communicate effectively with law enforcement, search and rescue, and first responders. In that 2018 disaster, local law enforcement agencies were made aware of our security presence and offered assistance when necessary. Security personnel halted access when search and rescue teams were active. Only authorized personnel were allowed access when local authorities deemed the property safe for employees.

The owners and security personnel of [Joint Power Security](https://www.jointpowersecurity.com/california/los-angeles) have direct experience providing emergency response security for your local businesses and private estates. Some of the personnel even assisted firefighters in their efforts to suppress flames to protect homes while it was safe to do so, and did so up until evacuations were in order. The resilience and commitment of security staff was immeasurable.

### Changes That Affect You

Last year in Montecito, new storm evacuation information was announced. The danger is still heightened for local businesses and those living below the Thomas Fire burn area. The community needs to be prepared. For more information you can go to the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s website at [sbsheriff.org](http://sbsheriff.org)

Recent changes in protocol with routine power outages were made in an effort to proactively prevent future fire hazards. This affects businesses and properties throughout [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), making them vulnerable to criminal activity and property breaches. For more information or to view current power outages, you can go to the SoCal Edison [website](http://sce.com)
