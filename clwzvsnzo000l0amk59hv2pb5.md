### Meaning Of A Church?

A church is a community of people who gather to worship, pray, and serve together, typically in a building or space dedicated to religious purposes. The term "church" can refer to:

* ***2\. The collective body of believers who gather at that location.***
    
* ***3\. The global community of believers across different locations and denominations.***
    

In Christianity, the church is seen as the body of Christ, comprising all those who have put their faith in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Personal Savior. Overall, the church is a sacred space where people come together to deepen their connection with God and with one another.
